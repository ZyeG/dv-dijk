DescriptionThis project examines routing algorithms and protocols in theory (distance vector & link statealgorithm in java emulation) and in practice (BGP and OSPF with mininet).

PartIWe started the project with simple routing algorithm implementations: finding shortest pathwith distance vector (DV) and Djikstraâ€™s link state (DL). Distance vector information iswrapped in a packet, scheduled to be sent from source to destination at a random time T(decided based on the seed set at runtime).

PartIIFor BGP (each router as an individual AS) and OSPF (all routers in one AS) simulation,most time was spent on experimenting with various tools and configuring parametersproperly for each tool to observe the routing behavior desired. We started with mininet, sinceit was introduced in class and we have worked with it in multiple labs; then integrated it withthe Quagga routing framework suite, so as to observe and compare convergence speed,throughput and jitter between BGP and OSPF.

## Description

Simple routing algorithm implementations: finding shortest path
with distance vector (DV) and Djikstraâ€™s link state (DL). Distance vector information is
wrapped in a packet, scheduled to be sent from source to destination at a random time T
(decided based on the seed set at runtime).
